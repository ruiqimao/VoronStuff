![Screenshot of CAD](Images/CAD.png)

This mod adds Annex K3 style handles to the BoxZero door.

It is designed to work with V3 version of [ZeroPanels](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels), with 3mm foam on the inside.

## Hardware

* 4x 3x5x4 heatset inserts
* 4x M3x8 FHCS **ferrous** screws
* 4x M3x8 BHCS screws
* 4x M3 nuts
* 2x 6x3mm magnets, preferably N52

## Drilling holes in the door

This mod uses ferrous FHCS screws to keep the door closed against magnets and to secure the handles on. As such, there need to be four M3 clearance holes drilled into the door.

A printed jig is included in the STLs to align the holes.

**When drilling acrylic, be sure to use a proper plastic drill bit to avoid cracking plastic.**

Alternatively, a DXF is provided with holes in place.
