# MiniAS Lower Strain Relief

There is space between the X carriage and Sherpa Mini motor on the Mini After Sherpa toolhead. Because of this additional space, the motor wires can be run downwards, then up the back of the motor.

This alternative strain relief makes use of that wire routing and allows the wires to come out lower.
